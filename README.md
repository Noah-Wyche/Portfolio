# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will record my programming journey and show off all of the wonderful things that I make along the way. I want to be continuously adding to this portfolio to ensure that I am always putting my best foot forward and ready for the next adventure.

## Installation

To use this application simply follow this link and you will be taken to my webpage: https://noah-wyche.github.io/Portfolio/

## Usage

This portfolio while it is a place for me to record my projects for personal use, it should also be a place where potential employers and colaborators will be able to view my work and asses my skills as a programmer.

The website does not require much explanation to be used effectively. There are navigation buttons at the top that will scroll the user to the matching section and if you hover over an image it will give you the project name. Clicking on an image will also take you to the associated project, although only one project is currently up and running.

## Authors

All code, and concepts are by me!
