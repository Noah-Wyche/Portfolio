                <p>    Hello! My name is Noah Wyche, I am 24, and I love learning new things. Like how to code for example!
                    I am fascinated with game design, and the process of building finished applications that can be used 
                    in the real world. As I continue on my never ending search for knowledge and adventure I hope that you 
                    can follow along and see the things that I have and will create. I currently live in Cary North Carolina
                    with my incredible wife and our three adorable cats. Before I started this journey into programming I 
                    was fed up with my old job and needed a new opportunity and a new challenge. I am learning a lot but I 
                    still have a lot to learn.
                </p>
                <p>     Throughout my profesional career my biggest search has been for something that I love doing and also has 
                    the chance to make a difference. I am happy to say that I think I have found that through programming.
                    Like any new skill it does not come easily, but with time it has taught me that there is nothing I cant 
                    achieve. 
                </p>
                <p>     Sometimes in this life it feels like the time that we have constantly slips through our finger. Which is 
                    why I am so passionate about doing something meaningful. After spending years of my life searching for meaning, 
                    I believe the greatest meaning that we can find is through our connections with each other and the simple joys
                    that we find on this big blue marble. If you are interested in my previous projects, my fututre projects, or you
                    just want to chat, you can find all of my contact information below. Egredere et esto magnus!!
