            <p>    Hello! My name is Noah Wyche, I am 24, and I love learning new things. Like how to code for example!
                I am fascinated with game design, and the process of building finished applications that can be used 
                in the real world. As I continue on my never ending search for knowledge and adventure I hope that you 
                can follow along and see the things that I have and will create. I currently live in Cary North Carolina
                with my incredible wife and our three adorable cats. Before I started this journey into programming I 
                was fed up with my old job and needed a new opportunity and a new challenge. I am learning a lot but I 
                still have a lot to learn.</p>
            <p>     Throughout my profesional career my biggest search has been for something that I love doing and also has 
                the chance to do some real good in the world. I am happy to say that I think I have found that through programming.
                like any new skill it does not come easily, but we time it has taught me that there is nothing I cant achieve.
            </p>
