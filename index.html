                <p>Hello! My name is Noah Wyche, I am 24, and I love learning new things. Like how to code for example!
                   I am fascinated with game design, and the process of building finished applications that can be used 
                   in the real world. As I continue on my never ending search for knowledge and adventure I hope that you 
                   can follow along and see the things that I have and will create. I currently live in Cary North Carolina
                   with my incredible wife and our three adorable cats. Before I started this journey into programming I 
                   was fed up with my old job and needed a new opportunity and a new challenge. I am learning a lot but I 
                   still have a lot to learn.
                </p>
